--- WHAT IS IT?

GLPI is the Information Resource-Manager with an additional Administration-
Interface. You can use it to build up a database with an inventory for your 
company. It has enhanced functions to make the daily life for the 
administrators easier, like a job-tracking-system with mail-notification and 
methods to build a database with basic information about your network-topology.



--- REQUIREMENTS (only tested with this setup, try it on your own)

1) Apache 1.3.>6 with PHP 4.03Pl1 (PHP3 doesn't work anymore)
2) MySQL 3.22.32




--- FRESH INSTALLATION

1) After unpacking the distribution, copy everything to your
webservers DOCUMENT_ROOT.

2) Create a new database named "glpidb" and use the included sql/GLPI-version-defaults.sql 
on it. This will generate the structure for GLPI and setup five default
users:









- Heldesk : Password "help", Helpdesk-Injector witch doesn't appaers on 
the users list. Don't remove it from the Database. 

- glpi : Password "glpi", login first with this user to complete the setup.
Do not remove it before creating another user with the Admin Type.


- post-only : Password "postonly", you can remove it from the database.

- tech : Password "tech", you can remove it from the database.

- normal : Password "normal", you can remove it from the database.

It will also generate some default entries in every table, you can delete
everything if you don't like it except the "Helpdesk" and a user with
administrative privileges (by default "glpi").


--- CONFIGURATION

1) Go to your /glpi/config/ and edit config.php p.php. 
 I suggest to start with tiny
modifications, so you will see what happens if you change something you
don't understand. 

2) Go to your /glpi/ and edit helpdesk.html, you can move this file
to your local intranet or somewhere else, where you like and modify it (as
long as the basic form-parameters are intact). The injector needs the
Helpdesk user generated by the default.sql-script. It can open a security
hole to the whole system, because no password is checked if the input is 
done via the injector. 


--- TESTING

1) You can test the installation by pointing your webbrowser to the
glpi-webserver. After logging in with "glpi" and looking around, I suggest
you first go in setup and fill out the dropdowns and templates to get it
working. Take care you understand the basic concept before you delete
something generated by the default-installation and start using it. The
database-modell is not very good and has no real constraints. There is also
no checking of the input from the forms, if you enter invalid data or remove
anything, you can not confirm it in an extra step.
